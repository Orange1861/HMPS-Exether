  # Religion Flavor
  religion_flavor_loc_default: ""
  church_of_man_flavor: "The Church of Man originated as an organized form of the various native beliefs of humans in [concept_noricum], incorporating the most worshipped deities and traditions on the continent into a united faith. Since then, the Church of Man has spread through the Dumonian conquests of [concept_zalaron], occasionally integrating new foreign gods into the pantheon."
  wild_fosirmi_flavor: "All elves used to follow the same gods of the Fosirmi, but the fracturing of elven society has created multiple branches of the faith that disagree about the interpretations of their gods. The wood elves spent centuries isolated from civilization and their kin, and the nature-focused gods of the fosirmi, such as Rillifane, have supplanted the likes of Corellon and Angharradh in importance. The wild fosirmi emphasizes harmony with nature and living off the land, eschewing arcane magic."
  southern_fosirmi_flavor: "All elves used to follow the same gods of the Fosirmi, but the fracturing of elven society has created multiple branches of the faith that disagree about the interpretations of their gods. The dark elves elves come from a matriarchal society, and reflect this in their religious views. The Southern Fosirmi brings the female gods to prominence, especially Corellon's first wife, Araushnee, who serves as the head of the pantheon."
  orthodox_fosirmi_flavor: "All elves used to follow the same gods of the Fosirmi, but the fracturing of elven society has created multiple branches of the faith that disagree about the interpretations of their gods. The High elves and some half-elves of [concept_zalaron] follow what is known as the Orthodox Fosirmi, which puts particular importance on magic and arts in order to emulate the chief deity Corellon."
  kragmorn_flavor: "Dwarven religion is based on the veneration of ancestors. Dwarves deem any ancestor of their clan to be worthy of worship, but especially heroic figures can earn the admiration all dwarves irregardles of clan ties. The dwarven faith has changed the least of any religion since the Age of Gods. The dwarves that spent almost a millenium inside their vaults kept praciticing all of their old rites upon waking up. The only significant addition has been the appearance of [GetGoods('cloudsilver').GetName], which dwarves believe contain a manifestation of ancestor spirits."
  hasal_flavor: "The Creed of Hasal is a grim faith, founded by Hasal Nezzelech, a gnome that fought humanity with the powers of necromancy. It asserts that death is oblivion, that the universe is uncaring, and that if the gods exist, they are cruel. Its followers study the secrets of blood and life, and because they believe that death is the end, they see nothing wrong with using the bodies of the fallen to serve the living."
  house_of_fate_flavor: "According to the House of Fate, it is not gods that dictate the lives of mortals but fate itself. For every life upon Exether, there is a beautiful story to be told; but it is rarely allowed to unfold. The faith has become notorious for its extravagant rites as gambling has become a core institution of the religion. Since gleaning your true destiny can only be done in moments of pure chance, House of Fate ministers have come to host games of chance as a method of prosyletizing."
  vurzaratmoda_flavor: "The \"Children of Vurzara\" consider Vurzara, mother goddess of the orcs, head of their pantheon. She is a nature goddess focused on growth through adversity and how birth and life are fueled by struggle and death. She teaches that nature gives what you need to survive, but you in turn are part of the natural order; your struggles are part of it, and your eventual death will be the soil supporting new life. Her symbols include carnivorous & pyrophytic plants; forest fires are within her domain. "
  zmikamki_flavor: "Followers of the \"Living Oath\" believe orcs must own their destiny, and are fiercly opposed to any meddling from the [concept_outer_planes]. This faith was founded after Skarrakh's death and the [concept_godsbane] by orcs who felt a need for new spiritual purpose. In modern times Zmikamki has become known for its many demon hunters, who fight powers of the [concept_fiend] in their homeland."
  skarrakhlot_flavor: "\"Skarrakh's Kin\" honor the memory of Skarrakh, deceased father god of the orcs, as the most important of their pantheon. Skarrakh was a hunter god focused on protecting one’s territory and primacy of the most dangerous. Primarily his teachings were to defend your family and your home. He taught mastery over your own emotions in pursuit of that goal; anger and violence are some of his few allowable outlets. His symbols include hunting weapons and dangerous animals."
  salt_crucible_flavor: "\"Salt Crucible\" refers to the collection of traditional folk beliefs of the Waste Walkers, more literally their belief that the hardships of the Salt Wastes must be overcome on a spiritual as well as physical level. Humans have lived in the area almost as long as the orcs have, and are most well known for their religious practice of deal making with any and all divine forces they can. A tribe may stike a deal with a devil one day and accept aid from a celestial the next; anything to survive but nothing that truly threatens their independence."
