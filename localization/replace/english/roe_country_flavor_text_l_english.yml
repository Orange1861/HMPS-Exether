  DUM_FLAVOR_TEXT: "The Empire of [concept_dumonia] is a land of ancient traditions and fading glory, once the center of human power before the rise of magic brought it crashing down. The [concept_nightfall] led to the collapse of most of the empire, and today only the heartlands on Noricum remain under imperial control. It must grapple with a host of internal problems lest it be reduced to an even more humiliating state. Internal divides and external enemies, the Empire will have to tackle and resolve those issues before it can even consider looking West to restore its former glory."

  ABR_FLAVOR_TEXT: "Albiar is a large Imperial province of the currently withering Dumonian Empire. Its loyalty is tenuous at best as only through proximity to the heartlands has Albriar been kept under the thumb of Crownpeak. Though as [concept_dumonia] continues to struggle to regain its footing after losing so much, the Albrian elite have ceased the opportunity to squeeze the Crown for more and more freedoms. In more recent times leading to the establishment of 'Albriar' as closer to a state-within-a-state instead of an Imperial holding. The Avalorean people thus enjoy far more autonomy in the Empire than its many other subjects currently; a fact which has caused great envy across the Empire... for if the Avaloreans can demand so much from the Crown, why can't they as well?"

  AUM_FLAVOR_TEXT: "Arelon is a small, although powerful, state that serves as the center of the [GetReligion('cult_of_the_sun').GetName] Cult of the Sun and its church hierarchy. It had long been a dominion within the Dumonian Empire, but now finds itself independent and poised to spread its influence to the foreign heathens. The state is said to be guided directly by Holy Kamiros, Lord of Light, with the Luminarch merely serving as His interpreter in His absence. Kamiros, The Bright Judge, works tirelessly to uphold this blessed land as a haven for all righteous believers. He drives away the darkness and spreads His divine light through His holy words. Arelon is a sacred land, a bridge between the mundane and the divine. It is a beacon for all who seek Kamiros' warmth and wish to embrace His teachings."
  YAN_FLAVOR_TEXT: "The Yanger Nomads are a people hailing from the the vast steppes of the western reaches of Noricum. Historically, these lands were a former imperial province of [concept_dumonia], the land ripe for wealthy Dumonian ranchers.  However, it was not the wealthy Dumonian landowner who would come to rule the steppe; but the horselords of the Yanger and their riders.  Now, [concept_dumonia] has retreated to its' heartland, and these steppes lay in control of men hardened by war. With much talk of magic and the return of the gods, people look for an answer. In the eternal skies of the steppes exists a chaotic storm, serving as a prophecy for the many religious of forthcoming change. The steppe-riders lie prepared to weather the storm once more."
  RVC_FLAVOR_TEXT: "The Midnight Court, Dreadmoor. A nation purely born from the Chaos of the [concept_nightfall] and the failure of Men. A state managed by Arch Vampires, the corrupt and fallen brethren of the Sunkissed. The humans which dwell in these lands are sickly and pale by nature, unhealthy and often short lived as their Vampire Masters view them as nothing more than cattle. Their bodies and souls nothing more than resources to be expended as seen fit by Vampires for they are potent Mages naturally.  Reviled by all and for good reason the Midnight Magocracy has isolated itself from the world. A land of mystery now to the Human nations around it Dreadmoor year by year becomes more of a threat to peace in Southern Noricum. The Vampire Lords are a greedy caste, and they will stop at nothing to extend their reach over more and more unwitting souls of which to dominate, corrupt, and expend. The question remains, do they have the cunning required to achieve their goals? Or will their greed be their undoing against the stout hearts of men?"

With the help of the Vairian Navy, Icebreaker Expeditionary Limited has taken over a Zakonish leviathan whaling colony, and expanded from there.  With the Vermillion Thicket displacing millions from the homeland, thousands of Vairian refugees arrive monthly, destitute and needing order. This the company provides as the fires of industry require more bodies against the cold. Penal labor has become commonplace, the worst jobs and living conditions going to convicts.  In this inhospitable northern land, progress must be forged like the steel prow of an Icebreaker. Will adversity forge an orderly society, or turn brittle and shatter with frost?"

The small amount of woodlands to its West forming a natural barrier which prevented Yanger tribes from attempting to settle the territory out of inconvenience. It is a densely populated city-state in current day that has in recent years fallen under the direct influence of Stagworth to its south. The larger Jalian state setting its gaze on the creation of a larger cultural union of Jalian people. Drysgolmark has thus become the first domino to fall in regard to Stagworth's plans. But that does not mean it cannot carve out a niche in the rising power's fledgling Empire. Rise, Drygolites! The time has come to show those Stagworthers that you are a prize to be cherished, not a stepping stone!"

This land has incurred the punishment of the nightbane, and Jurian answers the call. With fanatic fervor, he has established a foothold for the inquisition to carry out retribution and return these green pastures to the righteous. This expedition will prove his faith and spread the truth of Kamiros to the ignorant. But most important of all the oncoming campaign will once and for all exonerate the Sunkissed of their failure to protect Stonewise decades ago.

  DOV_FLAVOR_TEXT: "Dovedale, once a collection of minor provinces within the Empire, is primarily populated by Jalians. Its dense woodlands served as a natural barrier between the Empire's heartland and its eastern holdings. Despite their unimportant economic status, the Jalians thrived until the [concept_nightfall], when magical calamities shook the region. With the Empire stretched thin, the plight of Dovedale was neglected, leading to a popular uprising for independence. The Jalians banded together to combat the encroaching darkness, fighting a long, bloody, and costly war against magical beasts and mutants. The ends justified the means and by the end of this decades-long conflict 'Dovedale' would stand as the de-facto safest land in Noricum. Ironically right above perhaps the most dangerous place in all of Noricum; Dreadmoor..."
  ROF_FLAVOR_TEXT: "Rosecroft is yet another breakaway state in Southern Noricum. Initially the Rosecroftans had withdrawn from the mainland when the [concept_nightfall] ensued. The monstrous new wildlife proved too much for them and the last resort was pulling away to Caecarw which overcrowded the peninsula. This fact eventually leading to a small 'crusade' by Rosecroft's leadership to establish a beachhead on the mainland once more a decade later. The attempt saw success and a militarized holding in Bancfan was established. Decades have since passed as Rosecroft continues to exist in relative peace...however the arrival of the Inquisition to the South and the recent activity of Dreadmoor to the north leaves Rosecroft in a precarious position! Even more pressingly it seems agents of the Inquisition and the Midnight Magocracy have both entered the nation and begun a secret war upon one another already on Rosecroftan land..."
  FOX_FLAVOR_TEXT: "Stagworth, the former administrative capital of the Dumonian Empire's Eastern Noric provinces and cultural heart of the Jalian people. Initially loyal to the Crown during the Viceroy's war,  Stagworth joined the growing list of provinces breaking away from the Empire as supernatural incursions ravaged the land and requests for aid remained unanswered. This decision was not made easily as Stagworth pushed itself to its breaking point before Dovedale's revolt finally broke the back of the province and forced it to look out for its own citizens. The Jalians believed wholly in the Dumonian Empire. But those times have long since passed as nearly 40 years have come and gone since Stagworth declared itself independent. Much of the population no longer remembers the times of the Empire and a strong sense of Patriotism is felt by the Stagworth Jalians. The politics of Dunefield have begun deeper interests in Imperialism as a result. Already the Jalians of Drysgolmark has fallen beneath the thumb of Stagworth's influence...and yet still there is more cultural kin to be brought into the fold. But first one thing has become abundantly clear; Dreadmoor is becoming an issue that can no longer be ignored..."

  BIE_FLAVOR_TEXT: "Brackenshire is the birthplace of the Nivaskyan people, a Northern Noric culture that is famed for its resilience to the elements and hardship as well as its prowess in fishing and seafaring. During the height of the Empire's reach, Brackenshire narrowly avoided domination through the wide swathes of land occupied by their Yanger cousins, and through the deep pockets of their investor's guild. The Empire's wane in the decades since has allowed Brackenshire to slowly assert itself more firmly as a regional power. Dumonia no longer has the presence necessary to threaten potential imperialist interests... and the capitalists of Crystalbrook have already begun buying out the industry of the horselords to the south. Meanwhile, their kin of the North, Mistbourne lie ripe to be pressured into political union and even further north lie the land of Half-Giants...\n\nWill the Brackenshire Investor's Guild stand tall, or find itself subject to hostile takeover?"
  MBR_FLAVOR_TEXT: "Many, many centuries ago Nivaski settlers set out from the Bracken peninsula to colonize the lands of the north. In the times of the Empire it was a rather lawless region of the far north. Too problematic to bother settling or conquering. Not much has changed in that field even today beyond a more settled soceity as well as possessing a potent squidding industry which supplies dyes to Northern Noricum. Still. The Nivaski of Mistbourne are proud of their humble stature. They etch out an honest life in the chilly north and are far from any real threat to its national integrity. Though, its cousins in Brackenshire call for the unity of the Nivaski people...will Mistbourne answer the call? Beyond that there lays strange reports from the northern reaches of the country. Strange beasts emerging from the Whistling Summits and the sightings of stout humanoids who's skin is as black as tar itself. A cause for concern potentially and source of potential pressure to agree towards Crystalbrook's pressures for unity..."
  EVR_FLAVOR_TEXT: "Everglen is a relatively secluded exclave of Avalorean people that was fortunate enough to escape the reach of Crownpeak during the [concept_nightfall]. Its local geography left it benefitting little from being part of the Imperial economy, leaving the Avaloreans of Everglen paying tribute to the Crown for no real benefit. Independence was a no-brainer once the opportunity presented itself! Still, token contact is made between Albrian and Everglenian traders which exchange gossip and goods alike. In recent times its local lake has begun being exploited for wishstone and magic has slowly begun to penetrate into the Everglenian economy which might serve to springboard it from an irrelevant rump state to a center of magical learning in the far reaches of northern Noricum."

After departing as friends, the young Prince kept in diplomatic correspondance with the Kiarr, taking on a new Noric name as well as Kamiran missionaries to help modernize and develop his domain. As the Cult of the Sun entrenches it's grip on the Lonely Isles, can Larimora modernize without flying too close to the Sun?"

  AHO_FLAVOR_TEXT: "Despite the Nightfall, despite the Changeling epidemic, even despite the Viceroy's War, Achon still stands as a beacon of Magical Learning and Enlightment in a world darkened by ignorance and tribalism. While the Magocrats of Achon eagerly point to their cutting-edge technology as evidence of the superiority of Achonite minds, it is not an entirely honest presentation...The Secretkeepers, intellectually elite dwarves of a bygone era who live deep within the southern mountain of Vyndervoht, played a crucial role teaching the first generations of Achonite Magocrats how to forge power on the anvil of knowledge as the dwarves had done themselves in their own time. The Mages of Achon did not simply happen upon their knowledge due to their 'superiority', it was exchanged like any good for the military and economic strength of a weaker, but still powerful Achon. This reality is a closely-guarded secret which would undermine the patriotic and jingoistic rhetoric of Achon's Magocrats if it was public knowledge. As the saying goes, 'History is written by the victors' and Achon must ensure it writes the history of its people."
  ARR_FLAVOR_TEXT: "Arrador, once the Jewel of the Dumonian Empire, rose to prominence through unchecked innovation and wealth, becoming the Empire’s most influential territory outside Noricum. Its booming capitalist class, emboldened by the Empire's lack of oversight, seized the opportunity during the Nightfall disaster—a calamity that destabilized Dumonia. In the chaos, the rebellious Dorites and their allies declared war, swiftly defeating the Empire's forces and securing their independence.\n\nNow, nearly five decades later, Arrador stands as a titan of industry, but at a heavy cost. Industrial growth has concentrated power in the hands of factory-owning elites, while indentured servitude grips the working class. The state’s true rulers are no longer its officials, but the wealthy elite, whose control over the nation remains unchecked—at least for now."
  EBR_FLAVOR_TEXT: "The Republic of Ebridor stands as a humble entity along Settler Coast's northern coastline. The blowback of the Nightfall sent waves throughout Ebridor but the overall impact was moderate at best compared to neighboring Achon which suffered immensely in the aftermath. The Viceroy's War which transpired around this time also impacted Ebridor to a minimal extent. Arrador, ever savvy-minded for business promptly established warm relations with the fresh Republic. The passing decades consisted of creating a brand new society, and with the Dorites brinding in new ideas and technologies, the Eberri became an developed nation, joining the likes of Arrador. Even though the newcomers seemed honest and helpful, as it turns out they might have another goal for the Eberri. The nation is still haunted by its past, and the future is threatening. Only time can tell what will happen to the Eberri."
  PFL_FLAVOR_TEXT: "Pefril is an enigmatic realm of changelings, planetouched humans gifted with the ability to shift their appearance. Pefril is a nation born out of a rejection to oppression over the nature of the Changeling people. Banding together in the Hinterlands of what was once Achonite land and forming a nation state for the sake of freedom for Changelings and freedom to express their powers. But this freedom comes with a price, their now distant cousins, humans, carry a deep distrust for Changelings. Leading to a rejection and complete lack of recognition of the Pefrilan state by its neighbors.\n\nTo its north, the Magocracy of Achon eyes Pefril with a disdainful gaze. Viewing the country to be nothing more than a nation of squatters sitting upon rightful Achon territory. It is unlikely that there will ever be reconciliation with the Achonites...especially considering their continued oppression of Changelings unfortunate enough to be under their thumb. Hope however lies to the South as the Astral Consortium is a League of coin and and innovation, not tradition and pride. Perhaps the way to recognition and acceptance is a display of ingenuity to the Consortium? Membership would be a large boon to the fledgling nation..."
  VHT_FLAVOR_TEXT: "From the depths of Mount Vyndervoht the Vynduri Dwarves stirred some years prior to the Nightfall. The Archmages of their society awakening far ahead of the rest of Dwarvenkind. But they did not choose to spring from their mountain home, instead keeping to the protection of their sacred halls. Content to safeguard the collection of their culture's knowledge and conduct magical experiments from the safety of their mountain. The lack of practiced magic in the world pleased the Vynduri Archmages to a degree as they discovered that magic had returned to the world.\n\nQuietly they made use of it...and in doing so they came to discover that Khus had begun its secretive exploitation of magic. Sensing a disaster was soon to come, the Vynduri Mages set about preparations for such an event. Chief among this was subtly attempting to aid the neighboring Achonites as much as possible as the Vynduri had developed cordial relations with these men of reason. As expected the Nightfall transpired and the world was wounded mortally. In the advent of the destruction the Vynduri formally ended their isolationism and set out to deepen their ties with the Achonite peoples as the rest of Vynduri society arose from their entombment. Their desire to learn struck a cord with the Vynduri and thus the troves of Vyndervoht were opened to the select few Achonites who were allowed to learn mystical arts. This act would pave the way for the generations of Mages that rule Achon today. Currently Vyndervoht sits as a junior partner in an economic union with the Achonites. The Vynduri have benefitted greatly from this relation and there is lies little reason to break away from Achon. Especially when considering the disdain the Dwarves possess for Changelings...impure creatures wrought by the Nightfall and a perpetual reminder of the disaster brought on by the misuse of magic."
  CER_FLAVOR_TEXT: "Ceraun stood loyally with [concept_dumonia] during the Viceroy's War, fighting and falling alongside Dumonian soldiers. Yet, despite their bravery, Dorite tacticians secured a devastating victory. Wounded and weakened, [concept_dumonia] withdrew from the continent, severing Ceraun from the Empire and leaving it to fend for itself.\n\nIn the decades since, Ceraun has fought fiercely to establish itself as a military power in Settler's Coast. Through the subjugation of the Rivierling Halflings and brutal wars—culminating in large scale deployment of Wyldfire Tincture against the Buramog Orcs and the creation of the Plaguewood—Ceraun has partly achieved its ambition. Even [concept_dumonia] now recognizes its strength, forming an alliance and investing heavily in Cerunite lands. But this rise came at a heavy cost—blood, freedom, and countless lives, as the military junta clings to power under its last surviving leader, Ludric Zarnak."

This proved too much for most of the humans residing there, leading to a mass exodus of those who had no latent magical ability.\n\nBy quickly settling the sparsely populated land, the Tefereti elves seized this opportunity to call a single land their home since the age of gods. The magically-infused Lake Eutrater in the area empowered many of the elves with magic, allowing them to regain the powers of old. Although most of the remaining humans in the area are magically inclined, the elves are not quick to forget their mistreatment at the hands of humans and refuse to treat them equally.\n\nRecently, the subjugation of the Wood elves living in the Feylight Forest by the human nation of Thiral has caused outrage within the local poulation. Many have began demanding their leaders take action and free the elves from human rule.

Culminating in establishing a Personal Union and renaming it to the Principality of Kracia instead. For the people of Mistreach it remains unlikely they will ever have true self-determination. Though...Settler's Coast's relatively quiet political situation seems to be on the verge of an upheaval with its orchestrators yet to be revealed. Perhaps 'Kracia' can find opportunity to the South of Lake Bossard or maybe even at the peaks of Mount Yelfis? Kracia may yet be able to ride this tide of change...or perhaps it will be drowned beneath it?" 
  EMP_FLAVOR_TEXT: "Similar to Arrador, Emparal was a prospering province during the height of the Dumonian Empire. Similar to Arrador, Emparal fought for its independence in the Viceroy's War following the chaos of the Nightfall. Whilst Arrador did most of the heavy lifting, in this conflict, Emparal also contributed significant manpower and logistical support to the effort. Today Emparal continues to prosper as one of the richest nations along Settler's Coast. Will it settle for remaining in its 'Big Brother's' shadow to the North or will it carve out an Empire to the South? It faces a slew of issues such as the Orcs to their southern frontier and monitoring the developing political situation of the Darvak dwarves to its North. One wrong move could potentially undo decades of prosperity for the enlightened Bossardi state..."
  DAR_FLAVOR_TEXT: "The conclusion of the Nightfall saw the Dwarves of Mount Yelfis awaken from their self-entombment surrounded on all sides by unfamiliar faces and even more unfamiliar technology. Utterly encircled, the Dwarves were swift to interact with their industrious neighbors and learn of the last millenia's innovations. Decades later, this early necessity of curiosity has paid off handily as Darvak now stands as a giant of industry in the region. It now stands at the precipice of yet another massive societal shift as Yelfie leaders compete to carve out Darvak's path as an regional powerhouse...or perhaps something even greater?"

It is the first foremost of the 'Wasi', grandiose casino-cathedrals operated by djinni in worship of fate as a concept, rather than any particular god. Food and drink and rest are all free, yet everyone leaves the Nawi Oasis poorer than they came. The Chi'in Desert is hostile to all life, the not-so-distant Salt Wastes even moreso, in these places the sun burns so hot it is hard to feel as though any God is watching. The heat makes the House of Fate an appealing philosophy, believing one's life to be a cosmic dice roll away from changing for the better is a great way for mortal minds to bear their burdens. A Wasi simply serves as a way for believers to feel freed from the oppression of nature, in a comfortable place, and their fortunes are a small price to pay for a suspiciously cold glass of water...this is how the Wasi Qhuchuy has survived for millinea: a small, yet spiritually mighty empire of gambling. \n\nBut now, magic seeps through the veil like never before, rigging the game in the favor of those who can wield it. It is said the house always wins, and while the isolated Nawi Oasis has always been protected from foreign aggression by the vast, empty desert, as technology advances so too may foreign armies eager to exploit their vast deposits of Wishstone and Chimesilt..."

Pushed to the coast and oppressed for decades these Gnomes felt no other choice but to embrace the Dark Art of Necromancy when one of their own discovered its secrets, Hasal Nezzelech. Through hate in their hearts for Mankind and their exploitation of the dead, the Raviki have formed a powerful Meritocracy which has surged past that of the decadent Thalorians and handed these brazen fools defeat after defeat. Already two successful Crusades against this abhorrent Empire have come and gone, and the third begins on this day to finally shatter these ancient oppressors of the Gnomish people. The Soulwrought are ready to prove their worth to their creators to join Raviki society and the Gnomes of Ravik stand united to dissolve Thaloria and bring about the the Gnomish Age in Fraesoh!

Driftwyn is a land of merit, of natural talent and learned skill. Where the individual may rise to great heights, as long as they are resolved to work hard. Its cities are filled with modern marvels of engineering and magitech. The Driftwyn gnomes consider their society to be on the cutting edge of scientific progress. Those who witness their great mechanical clocktowers and whirling automatons will find it hard to disagree. \n\nThe inhabitants of these islands hold the enviable honor of being some of the few Raviki to escape domination by the Thalorian Empire. Still, the suffering of their fellow gnomes did leave its mark. Powerless to act, they were forced to watch the injustices unfold. The hole of bitterness this left in their hearts was eagerly filled by the Creed of Hasal and a renewed determination to protect gnome-kind and destroy its enemies. It was in Driftwyn where gnomes could freely organize and coordinate their struggles. And it was in Driftwyn that the famed Soulwrought constructs were first conceived. Soon, they would be sent forth to enact gnomish vengeance and usher in a new age."

Eager to finish the job, the Raviki have begun their Third and potentially final Crusade against the remnants of Thaloria. West Thaloria may be currently lost but there is still hope in the East. As Raviki troops and Soulwrought Battle-thralls march on Thaloria there will be no shortage of patriots willing to lay down their lives for the sake of Thaloria.
