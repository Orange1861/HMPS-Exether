  dcw_events.1.t: "New Order Emerges"
  dcw_events.1.d: "[SCOPE.sLaw('guild_bondage_scope').GetName] has funded Consortium airships in the skies and wishstone machines in factories, while nobles among the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('romantic_ig').GetName] convert their holdings into corporate shares."
  dcw_events.1.f: "The last echoes of resistance fade as the Astral Consortium's victory becomes complete. Throughout Arrador, wishstone-powered machinery hums, a symphony of progress that drowns out the final protests of the old guard. The air thrums with arcane energy from the surrounding machines, their steady pulse a constant reminder of who truly holds power in this new age."
  dcw_events.1.a: "The future belongs to those who build it."
  dcw_events.1.b: "They will not go quietly."

  dcw_events.2.t: "The Peace Breaks"
  dcw_events.2.d: "The streets of Brinewick echo with the sound of marching boots and whirring war machines."
  dcw_events.2.f: "What began as isolated skirmishes between corporate security forces and noble house guards has erupted into open warfare. The powder keg has finally ignited, and Arrador burns in machine-oil and magical fire. There can be no turning back now."
  dcw_events.2.a: "Brother against brother, progress against tradition."

  dcw_events.3.t: "An Uneasy Balance"
  dcw_events.3.d: "Time has tempered the sharpest edges of conflict between old and new power in Arrador"
  dcw_events.3.f: "The halls of power in Brinewick present a peculiar sight: nobles in hereditary regalia sit on corporate boards, while Consortium leaders adopt aristocratic affectations. Ancient family crests now share wall space with corporate insignias, a visual testament to the delicate dance between tradition and progress. Neither side has truly won, but perhaps Arrador is better for it."
  dcw_events.3.a: "Perhaps this is for the best."

  dcw_events.4.t: "Traditional Order Preserved"
  dcw_events.4.d: "Like an anchor in stormy seas, the old nobility has held fast against the tide of change."
  dcw_events.4.f: "The Consortium's attempts to reshape society lie in ruins, their ambitious plans curtailed by the combined might of traditional power structures. Throughout Arrador, wishstone-powered machines fall silent as ancient privileges reassert themselves. The old order has prevailed, though none can say for how long."
  dcw_events.4.a: "Tradition endures for a reason."
  dcw_events.4.b: "Their attempt to replace ancient rights with corporate tyranny will not go unpunished!"

  dcw_events.5.t: "Economic Liberty"
  dcw_events.5.d: "The [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('magnates_scope').GetName] have issued a revolutionary proclamation, declaring all guild contracts in their territories null and void."
  dcw_events.5.f: "The declaration spreads through merchant networks and trade houses, each copy bearing the seals of prominent noble families. In guild-bonded factories and noble-held estates alike, people whisper of its promise: freedom to trade, to work, and to enterprise without bondage to guild corporations."
  dcw_events.5.a: "True prosperity comes only with true freedom."

  dcw_events.9.t: "The Second Vinewell Convention"
  dcw_events.9.d: "Here, in the very hall where the original Vinewell Accords were signed, the future of Arrador's guild system hangs in the balance."
  dcw_events.9.f: "Decades of the Vinewell system have revealed both its strengths and weaknesses. While the corporate-feudal structure has driven unprecedented industrial growth and innovation, questions of worker autonomy and human dignity have grown too pressing to ignore. The question now is not whether to reform the Accords, but how far these reforms should reach."
  dcw_events.9.a: "Reinforce guild authority."
  dcw_events.9.b: "Dismantle guild privileges and protections."
  dcw_events.9.c: "Repeal the documents."

  dcw_events.10.t: "Final Journal of Lady Elara Clearbough"
  dcw_events.10.d: "The [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('magnates_scope').GetName] and the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('consortium_scope').GetName] have gathered, their faces grim as storm clouds, to attend the passing of an influential noble."
  dcw_events.10.f: "The reading begins.\n\n“Yesterday I walked my factory floors one last time. Young Mira Thornweave - barely twelve - was operating the same mechanical loom that took her mother's arm three years past. The sight haunts me still. We speak of corporate citizens and guild benefits, but I finally see the truth beneath our gilt-edged lies. We've bound generations to our machines as surely as any feudal lord ever bound peasants to soil.”\n\n“To those who find this: the ledgers are in my study's false bottom. Use them wisely. And to the debt-workers: I am sorry. We sold your freedom and called it opportunity. May those who follow do better than we did.”"
  dcw_events.10.a: "We honor her memory best by continuing her life's work, not dismantling it."
  dcw_events.10.b: "Let all of Arrador see the truth of “progress.”"

  dcw_events.11.t: "Declaration of the Landholders’ League"
  dcw_events.11.d: "We, the noble houses of Arrador, can no longer stay silent as the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('consortium_scope').GetName] tightens its grip on our nation's throat."
  dcw_events.11.f: "“The Vinewell Accords were meant to foster cooperation between old wealth and new enterprise. Instead, they have become a weapon wielded by the guilds to dismantle centuries of tradition and responsibility. A lord's duty is to protect those who work their land, not exploit them in service to endless growth. We demand immediate reforms to debt-labor practices and the restoration of traditional landholding rights. The soul of Arrador hangs in the balance.”"
  dcw_events.11.a: "Let us show them how quickly tradition crumbles when the coffers run dry."
  dcw_events.11.b: "Nobility means responsibility to those we protect."

  dcw_events.12.t: "Report from the Ministry of Labor"
  dcw_events.12.d: "The tension between the Consortium's industrial expansion and the magnates' opposition has reached critical levels."
  dcw_events.12.f: "Incidents of sabotage against factories have increased 300% since last year. Meanwhile, guild enforcers have begun seizing ancestral lands to satisfy defaulted loans. Most concerning is the growing military divide. The magnates command the loyalty of our traditional army regiments, while the Consortium's private security forces grow stronger by the day. The increase in force concentration suggests they are preparing for more than just strike-breaking.”"
  dcw_events.12.a: "The old order lacks both the vision and capacity to adapt to necessary progress."
  dcw_events.12.b: "No merchant guild should command such military might."
