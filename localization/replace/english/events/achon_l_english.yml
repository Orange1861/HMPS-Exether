  achon_succession.1.a: "End of an Era"
  achon_succession.1.b: "Bells are ringing in unison all throughout [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetCityHubName]. Word has spread that Pozhantr Shtoskovuj, the long time ruler of Achon, is dead. "
  achon_succession.1.c: "The Rock of Achon, the Shepherd of Magi, Dwarf-Friend, Old Man Pozzy.#bold  Pozhantr Shtoskovuj#! had been a staple of Achonite politics since the ravages of the [concept_nightfall] and the return of magic. Whatever crisis Achon endured, his calm and reassuring demeanor always managed to keep the people soothed and radical politicians on the fringes. Now he is gone and an eerie quiet has descended over the capital. His passing has left a void needing to be filled as the [concept_changeling_crisis] unfolds. As the weak and unpopular party chair of the Mage Collective assumes control, the nation holds its breath, waiting for what's to come next. \n\nBut first we must make sure to honor his legacy. There will be a grand wake soon, speeches will be held, and everybody who is anybody will be there."
  achon_succession.1.d: "What is going to happen now?"

  achon_succession.2.a: "No Dull Affair"
  achon_succession.2.b: "The state funeral has been derailed by the reveal that [concept_achon_agency] was headed by [concept_changelings]!"
  achon_succession.2.c: "The crowd’s mood was tense as speeches began. State security from the [concept_achon_agency], with their wishstone devices, were meant to ensure that no [concept_changelings] infiltrated the event. Politicians offered empty platitudes until the #bold SCA#! chief took the stage, launching into an impassioned tirade against the magocracy, [Concept('concept_changeling_crisis', '$changeling_discrimination$')], and his own agency’s misdeeds. As his speech reached its climax, his skin began to shift, revealing a changeling, still speaking passionately.\n\nThe crowd erupted in shock and anger as security rushed the stage, the event teetering on the edge of a riot. Amid the chaos, the final speaker, Pozhantr's former apprentice, Zvojtir Irmishkholm, took the stage. With fiery rhetoric, he quelled the crowd, promising political reform, strong leadership, and bold action against the [concept_planetouched] menace."
  achon_succession.2.d: "The time has come to act, no more half-measures."
  changeling_discrimination: "changeling discrimination"

  achon_succession.3.a: "No More Half-Measures"
  achon_succession.3.b: "Achon's political future is uncertain. The Mage Collective will have to choose a new leader."
  achon_succession.3.c: "As the Magocracy’s finest gathered, the mood was one of resignation, the outcome seemingly set. Then Zvojtir, the people's choice, took the stage.\n\n“My mentor always meant well, but he was naive. When he was my age, he brought magic to the people and forged peace with the dwarves, building great partnerships. But he always hoped the changelings could be like the Vynduri. They are #bold NOT#!. They have no wisdom to offer, and their presence disrupts our way of life. They are not like us—they think and feel differently. Their very being is twisted by unnatural magic. Who knows what devils might control them? Every face could be a falsehood, every friend a spy, every loved one a hidden threat. We cannot live like this. For our own sake and theirs, we must uncover them all and separate from them for good. May we never be ruled by fear again!”"
  achon_succession.3.d: "Extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures."
  achon_succession.3.e: "We will not be ruled by fear."
