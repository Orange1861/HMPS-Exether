  # Goods Flavor
  trinkets_flavor: ""
  blubber_flavor: "Blubber is a valuable commodity often sought after for alchemical or industrial purposes, most often as an intermediary to fuel. When refined and churned, it can produce magical oil conducive to reactions. Blubber itself is harvested from the toughened backs of fallen sea-faring leviathans."
  godsblood_flavor: ""
monster_essence_flavor: "Blood, bile, bones; any useful part of a monster from the head-to-the-tail is extracted for use across various magical industries. It is a common ingredient in [GetGoods('potions').GetName]."
  chimesilt_flavor: "Chimesilt is an ethereal substance renowned for inducing profound out-of-body experiences, bridging the gap between the mundane and the astral realms. This enigmatic drug is harvested from desolate regions like deserts and wastelands, where naturally manifests in the ground in small amounts. Fungi and insects can feed on naturally occuring chimesilt, and often act as the prime source from chimesilt is extracted."
  wishstone_flavor: "Wishstone is the crystallized magical essence of the outer planes, immense concentrations of coalesced energy allow for enchantments of ordinary objects. Thus imbuing the powerful energy of the exterior domains into the tangible world. Often found in deposits of crystals that occasionally fall from the skies."
  thaumacore_flavor: "A soul which has been trapped in a refined wishstone cage, which is one of the most efficient-and most controversial-energy sources in Exether. Each individual Thaumacore is so powerful that it can even power a living being called a 'Soulforged' all on its own, though this capacity is controversial even among Necromancers."
  cloudsilver_flavor: "Cloudsilver is a lighter-than air metal. Theorized to have come from the trapped souls of petrified dwarves who crumbled during the [concept_long_slumber] and had their souls merge with the mountain, this metal behaves much like dwarves afflicted with [concept_curse_of_the_mountain], in that it wants to seek out open areas like the sky."
