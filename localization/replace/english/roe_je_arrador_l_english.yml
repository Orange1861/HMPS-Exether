  je_dcw_countdown: "The Consortium Crisis"
  je_dcw_countdown_reason: "In the chambers of Brinewick's Grand Assembly, lords and corporate representatives exchange glares across the marble floor, their hands never far from wands or swords. The debate over guild authority has moved beyond civil discourse.\n\nFurther, in private clubs and corporate boardrooms across Arrador, both sides are quietly stockpiling weapons. The nobles have been recruiting wizards and summoning bannermen, while rumors speak of the Consortium constructing battalions of enchanted automata in secret facilities. The Astral Consortium's vision clashes violently with the nobility's traditional powers, and peaceful resolution seems increasingly unlikely.\n\nSome whisper that the first shots have already been fired, suspicious accidents at guild facilities, mysterious disappearances of noble heirs, warehouses found reduced to ash. The tension builds like pressure in a malfunctioning steamwork, and all of Arrador holds its breath, waiting for the inevitable explosion.\n\nIn the end, it seems, the future of millions of guild laborers will not be decided by government procedure or economic theory, but by whatever weapons their supposed protectors choose to wield against each other."

  je_dcw_war: "The Consortium War"
  je_dcw_war_reason: "Steam and arcane residue stream into the sky as another day of civil war grips Arrador. What began as a struggle between noble houses and corporate interests has transformed into a battle for our nation's soul. In every province, the war manifests differently - from savage battles between soldiers and mages in the industrial heartlands, to subtle conflicts of influence in the rural estates.\n\nThe outcome of this struggle will determine more than just who holds power in Arrador. It will decide the very nature of our society: whether we will embrace a future ruled by corporate efficiency and industrial magic, or maintain the traditional balance of noble authority and ancient power. The wounds from this conflict will shape our nation for generations to come, as Arrador struggles to reconcile progress with tradition, innovation with heritage, and the relentless march of industry with the weight of centuries."

  je_vinewell_accords: "The Vinewell Accords"
  je_vinewell_accords_reason: "#white #italic A masterwork of political compromise - or the chains of our own making#!#!\n\nIn the wake of the [concept_nightfall] and the decline of the [SCOPE.sCountry('dumonia_scope').GetNameNoFlag], the emerging merchant powers of [concept_zalaron] had grown to rival traditional political authorities. The newly formed [ROOT.GetCountry.GetNameNoFlag] faced a critical decision: either engage in a costly struggle against these economic titans or forge a compromise that would ensure stability and progress. #variable The Vinewell Accords#! emerged as the solution, establishing a delicate balance between merchant autonomy and political sovereignty. These agreements granted the merchant guilds unprecedented autonomy within and beyond national borders while extracting promises of political neutrality and military restraint.\n\nThe Lord-Governors, barred from political office, yet unfettered in their commercial endeavors, soon proved that gold flows more freely than votes. Their #bold Astral Consortium#! arose like a second government, wielding influence through purse strings rather than proclamations. Now, enchanted streetlamps illuminate the consequences of our bargain: prosperity and innovation walk hand in hand with wage-bonds and guild monopolies."
