The food was a blend of spices and vegetables unknown to anyone in our party, and the chef declared this was their first time preparing ‘mortal food’ in at least a hundred years - and then explained to us that the elves here survive on sunlight.\n\nI saw some elven children in the palace playing with toys made of gold. When I inquired about the excess, our host was confused before explaining that in this place gold was as common as sand. Our hosts seemed only politely interested in the affairs of Exether, and when pressed about potential trade, their ruler had prepared a large wagon-train of treasure for us to bring back home. They expressed little interest in regular contact with the rest of Exether, and tergiversated. After much cajoling I was finally handed a tattered veil, which almost startled me in comparison to the meticulous perfection we were surrounded with. Their ruler told me that the Great City would open their doors to Exether if I could sieve sand through the veil for a hundred years without a single strand coming loose.

 beauty_in_bloom.1.f: "As magical roses appeared after the [concept_blooming], they became an important symbol for the humans of Thiral. But the roses didn't just bloom for anyone. Those deemed unworthy or selfish could not approach them without wilting the flowers. These 'Unbloomed' roses became a symbol of sin and moral failing, driving a renewed effort in purifying society and enforcing the chivalric code.\n\nThe perceived religious failings of the unbloomed roses, coupled with the arrival of magic, enhanced the power of the Florensires over the peasantry. With the roses from The Blooming granting magical abilities tied to virtue, the Florensires were able to protect, heal, and sometimes punish with divine force. These powers were seen as evidence of their sacred status, reinforcing their superiority.
