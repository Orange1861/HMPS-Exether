 #Racial Techs
 
  human_tech: "Human Ingenuity"
  human_tech_desc: "Humanity; the favored race of the Gods. That is what ancient humans believed in the Age of Myth at least. Humans are a well-spread species across Zalaron in particular. Nearly every corner of the Supercontinent has these supple-skinned bipedal creatures who're especially quickwitted and innovative. While far from being individually the most intelligent species in the Realm, Humans by far are without equal Masters of discovering new ways in which to be lazy. The Arcane Revolution's birth at the hands of Humans is no coincidence!"
  dwarf_tech: "Dwarven Engineering"
  dwarf_tech_desc: "Having just been awoken from their millenea-long slumber by the Nightfall, what were once grandiose empires reknowned across the world have become ruins deep within mountains isolated from the last 1,000 years of history. Ever pragmatic, the Dwarves have by and large seen this new world order as an opportunity to reforge their own place within it, reviving ancient techniques and knowledge while sharing that knowledge only with those who cooperate. Despite their competition having a headstart, the Dwarven people are nonetheless set on striking while the iron is hot."
  elf_tech: "Elven Beauty"
  elf_tech_desc: "Elves are a long-lived race in Exether. In terms of overall population? Elves ARE the longest living race in the Realm. While far from immortal their incredibly slow aging leave them statically pristine for decades at a time, sometimes even longer. More than that Elves are closely attuned with the usage of magic. This fact is what ultimately lead to the decline of Elven power throughout the Age of Men. The disappearance of magic left Elves weakened to the whims of other dominant geopolitical forces. But as of the Nightfall...magic has returned and with that the Elves of Exether too have regained much of their strength."
  half_elf_tech: "Half-Elven Diplomacy"
  half_elf_tech_desc: "WIP"

  gnome_tech: "Gnomish Curiosity"

  mechanical_tech: "Clockwork Instincts"
  mechanical_tech_desc: "WIP"
  dragon_tech: "Draconic Heritage"
  dragon_tech_desc: "The Dragonborn have long upheld the values of their Masters, even after the Dragons of Exether largely vanished with the disappearance of magic after the Godsbane. Today, they maintain this discipline, while their devolved kin, the Kobolds, fanatically cling to the traditions of their long-dead Masters. Whether guarding hoards, amassing gold, or exploring ancient ruins, the Children of Dragons remain proud of their heritage no matter how far into history their forebearers fade."
  goblin_tech: "Goblin Hordes"
  goblin_tech_desc: "Ancient Goblin Historian Thue Sun described the previous 1,000 years of Khaara Ur's history as a 'Goblin Tide', wherein this cycle repeats itself: warlords fight, one comes out on top, his family reigns supreme for a while, then the family falls out of favor with their people, the warlords rise up and take over, and invariably fight one another for true dominance, completing the cycle. That book was written nearly 4,000 years ago, but still holds true all these years later. War is something which comes in and out like the tide for Goblins across Exether. It is neither good, nor bad, it simply is, and that apathy manifests in a variety of ways on the battlefield."
  planetouched_tech: "Planetouched Understanding"
  planetouched_tech_desc: "The unique perspective given to the wide variety of cultures and species which did not originate from Exether, generally called 'Planetouched' by other peoples, creates an innate connection to the supernatural in some shape or form. Djinni are powerful illusionists and charmers, Changelings can shapeshift at will, but all Planetouched know they are strangers on this planet, whether they were born here or not. As magic seeps deeper and deeper into the roots of this place, perhaps more of their abilities will awaken?"
  ogre_tech: "Ogre Gluttony"
  ogre_tech_desc: "Ogres are a gluttonous race, with each and every Ogre intent on scouring life for the next 'good time' they can get their meaty hands on. Be it food, intoxicants, carnal affairs, or the thrill of battle, Ogres tirelessly remain on this pursuit for glee and amusement. They are creatures of large stature, and what they lack in brains they make up for with overwhelming violence and might. The pursuit of happiness for an Ogre is not just a lofty ambition, it is an addiction baked in to the foundation of their diminished psyches."
  monster_tech: "Monstrous Adaptation"
  monster_tech_desc: "WIP"
  bird_tech: "Avian Freedom"
  bird_tech_desc: "WIP"
  mouse_tech: "Mousefolk Multitudes"
  mouse_tech_desc: "Mousefolk have been a very insular race for the majority of their existence. Rarely have they left their homelands across Exether and they tend to grow massive sprawling communities where they dwell. Despite their relative isolation they remain open to outsiders who are of no threat to them. Still, this willingness to accept should not be viewed as weakness. Despite the titanic size of their communities Rodents form tight-knit groups spamming hundreds, if not thousands of members with relative ease. Ever quick to come to the aid of their fellow countrykin, be there blood relation or only social."
  orc_tech: "Orcish Grit"
  orc_tech_desc: "Orcs are a proud and hardy species, known in ancient times as the guardians of wild places. The orcs have fought many brutal wars throughout history, and are renowned for their resilience in the face of hardship. No matter the conditions, the orcs have found ways to survive. Seldom thriving in present times due to the corruption which the Nightfall has wrought on Nature, they have begun to view themselves above simple luxuries. For an orc, to struggle and survive is luxury enough."
  halfling_tech: "Halfling Comfort"
  halfling_tech_desc: "Halflings are by far one of the friendliest races in Exether, renowned for their universal hospitality in a world so quick to discriminate and judge. It is hard to keep a Halfling down, and this mentality has secured them the comfortable status beneath the thumb of Humanity in Settler's Coast."
  giant_tech: "Giant Might"
  giant_tech_desc: "WIP"
  awakened_tech: "Awakened Samvega"
  awakened_tech_desc: "The fauna of Locari was suddenly awakened by a massive explosion of psionic energy that rocked the continent, and which still causes psionic storms. Emerging from the wilderness, these people started their lives shocked, confused, and with a sense of urgency to understand themselves and the world they find themselves in. They retain their natural neophobia with their newfound curiosity. Awakened Fauna are incredibly sensitive psionic creatures, and have the natural ability to sense the emotions and intent of other creatures, and to internalize and mirror particularly strong or persistent moods from others. As a consequence, the different Awakened cultures have been profoundly impacted by their first meeting with the other races of Exether. The simians faced fear and hate, and so they fear and hate. The binturong faced cautious curiosity, and therefore are cautiously curious. The bears of the east coast, isolated from the wider world until recent times, have the most opportunity to change. But whomever the Awakened is, they are gripped by the anxious sense of urgency to discover what a life as a sentient being really means."
  naga_tech: "Naga Cruelty"
  naga_tech_desc: "The Naga were, for almost all of history, the singularity that all Locari orbited. They haunted Locari like specters, snatching up entire communities to sacrifice on their dark temples. Naga have a culture revolving around domination and a deeply rooted need to exercise power over others. Their entire species was specifically made by their dark god for this purpose. The fall of their dark empire, the Jundɑugkettho, has forced them into the shadows as their vile, well-honed methods of coercion and violence are used against each other. If the Naga were ever able to restore the Jundɑugkettho Empire, and incorporate the horrible methods of war common to this new age of magic, there’s no telling what horrors they may unleash…."
  hiadud_tech: "Hiadud Melody"
  hiadud_tech_desc: "The Hiadudan people share a tragic origin. Asuroth, angels of the dark gods Teomatki and Xocarati, and their naga followers, would capture entire communities and perform experiments that twisted the Hiadud to master's nefarious purposes. They were a slave species, used to build mighty ziggurats. But the Namkhaven were not as servile as their masters believed, and in an act of heroic sacrifice, a massive uprising and a mysterious ritual banished the Asuroth from Exether as the dark angels were preparing to sweep over the world. Namkhaven are the unsung saviors of Exether. The Hiadud are proud, grim, and introspective people. They are natural psionics, with the power imposed on them so that the Asuroth and naga could relish feeling their suffering. Now free, they use their psionics to defend their communities, honing this skill and their martial arts to prepare for the day the Asuroth will return. However, the abrupt arrival of modernity has caught these patient guardians flat-footed. Ancient martial arts and monk orders may do little against a line of field artillery."
