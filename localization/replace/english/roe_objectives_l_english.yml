These mountain farms have become an essential source of food for both the dwarves themselves and the surrounding dark elf settlements."

  objective_settler_coast_desc_AHO: "In the northeast of Zalaron, the nation of Achon, once a shining beacon of magical innovation and prosperity, now remains only as a shadow of its former self. The Nightfall ravaged the land, leaving it scarred and twisted. \n\nDespite the devastation, the people of Achon have persisted, rebuilding what they can in the wake of the cataclysm. But their efforts are hampered by a growing paranoia that has gripped the nation. The cataclysm was accompanied by a surge in the number of changelings and mimics, shapeshifters who can take on the form of any creature they encounter.\n\nThe people of Achon are now constantly on edge, never sure who they can trust. The government has enacted strict measures to root out changelings and mimics, with many living in fear of being accused of being a shapeshifter."
