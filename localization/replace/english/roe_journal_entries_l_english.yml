Years of mutual reliance have led to this unprecedented alliance, combining Yavira's rich soils with Vozmead's unmatched craftsmanship.

  je_grey_boar_reason: "The long shadow of Margrave Ludric Zarnak, once a figure of unwavering strength and iron will, now flickers as his health deteriorates. For nearly half a century, he has been the indomitable ruler of Ceraun, first as a hero of the Viceroy's War, then as the architect of a bloody coup that shattered the old nobility. His legacy is marked by the brutal Buramog Wars against the western orcs and the infamous order to the alchemists that unleashed the devastating Wyldfire Tincture, transforming the Wrentsay Forest into the cursed Plaguewoods.\n\nNow, with every raspy cough and weakening breath, the old Margrave’s hold on power slips. His once-loyal subjects, now wary and ambitious, circle him like vultures, eager to fill the inevitable power vacuum. The future of Ceraun teeters on the edge, as the looming struggle for succession threatens to plunge the realm into chaos. How long can the old strongman cling to life—and power—before his rivals strike?"

This initial victory emboldened the gnomes and left the Thalorians reeling.\n\nIn the second crusade, the gnomes unleashed the Soulwrought—resurrected humans encased in metal bodies—against the Thalorian forces. The devastation was immense, fracturing the western reaches of the Thalorian Empire and leaving a scar on the land and its people.\n\nNow, the third crusade ignites, with the gnomes determined to dismantle what remains of the Eastern Thalorian Empire. As both sides prepare for another brutal confrontation, the fate of the empire hangs in the balance, and the echoes of past conflicts threaten to shape the future in unforeseen ways."
